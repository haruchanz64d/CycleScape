  textDescription:
  - The Follicular phase is the preparation of the ovaries to release an egg cell.
    Uterus lining thickens again.
  - In this phase, your health will slowly decrease, and you will see waves of objects
    appear. Red objects will hurt you, while green objects will heal you.
  - In addition to these regular objects, you will also see moon objects appear during
    this phase.
